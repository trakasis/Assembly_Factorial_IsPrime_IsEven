# Assembly_Factorial_IsPrime_IsEven
A program I made for my Assembly class where I had to find the factorial of a number, determine if it was prime, and determine if it was even.

As per program specifications, I had to:

-write a recursive procedure called Factorial to calculate the factorial of a number and store it in the appropriate variable

-write a procedure called IsPrime to determine if a number was prime and to store a one in the least significant bit of "mynum_flags", otherwise it would be zero (has to be a positive, prime number)

-write a macro called IsEven to determine if a number was a positive even number, and to store a one in the second bit of "mynum_flags" (otherwise it would be zero)


-possible values for mynum_flags:

0 = not prime, not even

1 = prime, not even

2 = not prime, even

3 = prime and even (only applicable for the number 2)
